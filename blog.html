There are three kinds of judgment:<br><br>
      
      
           \( \Gamma\) ctx               \(\Gamma \vdash a: A\)              
      \( \Gamma \vdash a \equiv a': A\) <br><br>
      
      A <i>context</i> is a possibly empty list \(x_1 :A_1, x_2: A_2,...,x_m:A_n\) in which the variables \(x_1,...,x_n\) are all distinct and the \(A_1,A_2,...,A_n\) are types. 
      We use \(\cdot\) to denote the empty context. 
       
      There is really no distinction between terms and types unlike in weaker type systems. Types are certain kinds of terms. We now specify the syntax of terms. Our presentation
      will be geared towards implementing a proof assistant and proof checker. For a given environment we will have a list of <i>defined constants</i> \(f,f',f'',...\) along
      with the built-in <i>primitive</i> constants \(c,c',c',...\). Terms are defined as usual as untyped \(\lambda\)-terms:<br><br>
      
      
            \( t::= x \quad |\quad \lambda x.t\quad |\quad  tt' \quad |\quad  c \quad |\quad  f \)<br><br>


We have primitive constants \(\mathcal{U}_0,\, \mathcal{U}_1,\, \mathcal{U}_2,...\) which are a cumulative hierarchy of universes. The rules of inference for
judgments \(\Gamma\) ctx are the following<br><br>

(A) If I take a sufficently small quantity (a grain) from a 'heap' then the 'heap' remains a 'heap'. I can then form in this way a chain of locally valid deductions which are false globally. <br><br>
(B) If given a locally constant sheaf on a topological space X ( = covering space on X). I consider the stalk $F_x$ at a point x then there is a small enough neighbourhood U(x) such that the stalk $F_y$ at all y in U(x) 'looks the same' as $F_x$. I can form a closed path from x to x and transport an element w in $F_x$ in a locally trivial way such that I end up with a non-trivial transformation on $F_x$ (monodromy).<br><br>
In homotopy type theory equality types A=B are 'spaces', infinity groupoids.

But many phenomena in nature are observed to be non-reversible, "dissipative", hence not having time-reversible solutions. For instance, a glass falling off the table and breaking.
The big question is: can the second law of thermodynamics be deduced from the fundamental differential equations of physics ?<br>
Or more generally are there differential equations whose solutions are mostly entropy-increasing ?<br>
On the other hand can we find (a system of) differential equations whose solutions are generally entropy-decreasing ? Or in which entropy-decreasing phenomena occur in relatively frequent bursts ? Differential equations which would have solutions in which the pieces spontaneously assemble into the glass on the table ? <br>
Contemporary physics is essentially incomplete (cf. the need for dark matter, dark energy, extra dimensions, etc.). Perhaps in the complete picture entropy is actually strictly conserved. The entropy-increasing forces/fields are counterbalanced by (at present unknown) entropy-decreasing ones, in which entropy-decreasing phenomena occur in relatively frequent bursts.
Then it is the this entropy-increasing aspect of nature that is the main cause of life, the cause of the relatively frequent bursts of increased self-organisation and complexity (which would then be further modulated (or "selected") by the constraints of the environment and the ecosystem).<br>
Perhaps the "collapse of the wave-function" could be approached thermodynamically as well ?</p></span>

Make philosophy a fruitful objective collaborative endeavour in which a pluralism of views is accompanied by objectively rigorous argumentation framed in explicit and mutually agreed upon systems of formal philosophical logic. Extending Hilbert's program to science and philosophy is also a way of partially realising Leibniz's goal of a calculus ratiocinator and characteristica universalis.
The difficulty of the specialised problems usually considered in philosophical logic and the philosophy of language should not let us loose sight of the essential role and goal of formal logic in philosophy.
The benefit of this approach is its ontological and epistemological neutrality. The only thing required is the acceptance of the objective (interpersonal) value of engaging with others in this game of setting up formal systems and finding and checking arguments.
This project must not be confused with projects of formalising merely the common use of natural language or with research in automatic translation, the finding of an interlingua, web ontologies, etc. <br><br>

To us philosophy must start with asking the question: what is a philosophical argument ? What makes a philosophical argument valid or pursuasive ? And if there is any way to answer this, then there must be a formal answer as well. That is, all meaningful philosophical discourse must be able to be framed within the context of a mutually agreed upon formal axiomatic and deductive system. Ambiguity or vagueness is not a virtue in any philosophical text. <br><br>

One cannot use Gödel's first incompleteness theorem as an argument against formal philosophy. Why ? Because this theorem is validated by the circumstance that it itself can be completely formalised within Primitive Recursive Arithmetic. It is a formal philosophical result. PRA formally 'knows' that Peano Arithmetic is proof-theoretically incomplete.<br><br>

This is a daunting task. Some places to start are the examination of the work on intensional logic, knowledge representation, multi-agent systems and general systems theory, specially more axiomatic and mathematical approaches to physics (axiomatic QFT, quantum gravity) and biology (such as systems biology).<br><br>

Greimas or Per Aage Brandt, we find that they are based on huge unquestioned scientific and philosophical assumptions. These assumptions insinuate themselves to colour the entire architectonic of modern semiotics.
The first assumption is materialist neural-reductionism. This unquestioned assumption is used as a rhetorical tactic to justify hasty theoretical generalisations and limitations of consciousness, such as Brandt's semiotic base space and his theory of the present moment which is justified at most by some hand-waving gibberish about "the experiental present being built up in neural-time through integration". This is "naturalised" phenomenology which ignores all of Husserl's work and arguments. It is contradicted by philosophical meta-cognition and by abstract conceptual logical and mathematical thought in general, by states of consciousness achieved during meditation which are lucid yet not spatio-temporally localised or individualised. Also we can compare the banality of this naturalism to the interesting theories of Schopenhauer on artistic contemplation having as as condition the abrogation of individuation in space and time.
The second assumption involves sweeping under the carpet the problems of the foundations of logic and mathematics, regarding the nature of logic, of meaning, of concepts and of mathematical entities and propositions. Mathematics employs signs certainly but only a crude nominalist conventionalism would equate them with symbols in the sense of Brandt. Brandt's classification of signs is thus fundamentally inadequate and incomplete. Also, as far as "natural" signs goes, what exactly is this "causality" he mentions ? 

For French-language academic philosophy the situation is sad. From the second half of the 20th-century onwards we have a complete and total eclipse of non-physicalist and rationalist (formal logic based) philosophy. Jean-Louis Gardies is a notable exception and perhaps also Vuillemin and Bouveresse. Even slightly earlier, in the country of Descartes, Malebranche, Arnauld and the Port-Royal, Lachelier and Boutroux there were only few notable exceptions such as Albert Lautman (who was an immigrant), Brunschvicg or Gaston Berger. We will examine in the future both 19th-century "ontologism". On the other hand in biology France gave us Pierre Grassé and France's contribution to pure mathematics was outstanding (cf. the Bourbaki group and modern algebraic geometry). In Belgium there is a follower of Whitehead, Michel Weber.</p></span>

written a century ago. It is indeed remarkable how the way we do mathematics has stabilised.
The difference between the mathematics of 1922 and 2022 is small compared to that between the mathematics of 1922 and 1822.
Looking beyond classical ZFC-based mathematics, a tremendous amount of effort has been put
into formalising all areas of mathematics within the framework of program-language implementations (for instance Coq, Agda) of the univalent extension of dependent type theory (homotopy type theory).
But Coq and Agda are complex programs which depend on other programs (OCaml and Haskell) and frameworks (for instance operating systems and C libraries) to function. In the future if we have new CPU architectures then
Coq and Agda would have to be compiled again. OCaml and Haskell would have to be compiled again.

Both software and operating systems are rapidly changing and have always been so. What is here today is deprecated tomorrow.
My question is: what guarantee do we have that the huge libraries of the current formal mathematics projects in Agda, Coq or other languages will still be relevant or even "runnable" (for instance type-checkable) without having to resort to emulators and computer archaeology 10, 20, 50 or 100 years from now ?
10 years from now will Agda be backwards compatible enough to still recognise
current Agda files ?
Have there been any organised efforts to guarantee permanent backward compatibility for all future versions of Agda and Coq ? Or OCaml and Haskell ?
Perhaps the formal mathematics project should be carried out within a meta-programing language, a simpler more abstract framework (with a uniform syntax) comprehensible at once to logicians, mathematicians and programers and which can be converted automatically into the latest version of Agda or Coq ?</p></span>

        <i>
        
         Fate has not been kind to Gottlob Frege and his work. His logical achievement, which dwarfed anything done by logicians over the preceding two thousand years, remained all but ignored by his contemporaries. He liberated logic from the straight-jacket of psychologism only to see others claim credit for it. He expounded his theory in a monumental two-volume work, only to find an insidious error in the very foundations of the system. He successfully challenged the rise of Hilbert-style formalism in logic only to see everybody follow in the footsteps of those who had lost the argument.
         Ideas can live with lack of recognition. Even ignored and rejected, they are still there ready to engage the minds of those who find their own way to them. They are in danger of obliteration, however, if they are enlisted to serve conceptions and purposes incompatible with them.
         This is what has been happening to Frege's theoretical bequest in recent decades. Frege has become, belatedly, something of a philosophical hero. But those who have elevated him to this status are the intellectual heirs of Frege's Hilbertian adversaries, hostile to all the main principles underlying Frege's philosophy. They are hostile to Frege's platonism, the view that over and above material objects, there are also functions, concepts, truth-values, and thoughts. They are hostile to Frege's realism, the idea that thoughts are independent of their expression in any language and that each of them is true or false in its own right. They are hostile to the view that logic, just like arithmetic and geometry, treats of a specific range of extra-linguistic entities given prior to any axiomatization, and that of two alternative logics—as of two alternative geometries—only one can be correct. And they are no less hostile to Frege's view that the purpose of inference is to enhance our
         knowledge and that it therefore makes little sense to infer conclusions from premises which are not known to be true.
         We thus see Frege lionized by exponents of a directly opposing theoretical outlook.

of serving as a semantics for natural languages.<br>
It will be influenced slightly by game design and OS design. However we may conceive that there is authentic parellelism. At each moment in time we are given
a list $L$ of active objects. Each object has its methods and fields and besides its initialization method its update() method. The universe $U$ is the master object which contains $L$
as a field and its cycle involves calling update on all the objects on $L$.<br>
Each object will also have a <i>processes</i> field which indicates which method is being executed. We can avoid deadlock and there can be interrupts and signals with different priority. Objects also will have their <i>logs</i>. Objects can also create objects must this event and its parameters must be registers within $U$.<br>
What is space ? There is a $Map$ object which contains the current locations of all objects, a map and has methods  where(), look() and go(dir). Space is thus a mediating interface and constraint which all objects interact with. In Python we can use the inspect module. Objects should know who is calling their methods ! Also interactions between objects can be of the streaming type. <br>
The higher objects will engage in exploration, automatic proof checking and proof generation. They will "seek" to "understand" their own code, the code of other objects and the code of the whole "universe" or community. Self-reflection, as Hofstadter recognised, is a  fundamental profound concept in philosophy and artificial intelligence and only ignorance, shallowness or dogmatism could justify discarding or down-playing it ! <br>
We should consider self-understanding, construction of models of others based on interaction, and the combination of the two. Objects can have models, representations, of the entire community (including itself). An object can have "innate" access to the class hierarchies which serve as <i>a priori</i> templates to organise data. <br>
Systems which can represent themselves and can reason about themselves, partial embeddings of the metalanguage in
the language, the proof predicate, the truth predicate, intensional abstractions.<br>
Question: if in a first-order system $T$ we can define a codification of the language and a proof-predicate which captures
being a proof then $T$ must be able to express arithmetic ?<br>
Objects can also examine (reflection in Smalltalk) and modify their code (assumedly in small but important ways) and their replicated version of themselves (based perhaps on an abstraction of genetics).<br>
Think of a category $T$ and a (pseudo)functor $s: Cat \rightarrow T$. The fiber above each object $t$ in
$T$ will be a category $C_t$. The objects are the...objects and morphisms are the  instantaneous state of their interactions and (internal) processes. However we must deal with parameters in the morphism. Note that <i>references</i> to objects rather than objects themselves are mostly passed as parameters.<br>
The higher floors, the realms of mathematical objects are also organised naturally into categories (or higher categories), for instance, the category of schemes and the morphisms between them. In general if an object is a sheaf over some space $X$ then we can view taking sections $\Gamma(U)$ as calling a method with parameter $U$.<br>
Our objects can also have <i>analytic oracles</i>, that is, they can compute the value of convergent power series to any degree of precision (for any complexity class of the coeficients). In fact we can consider that each object is endowed with an internal scheme, stack or other algebraic-geometric structure which determines its structure and behaviour.
In this ontology we perceive at once the different kinds of functionally distinct languages contained in the common notion of "language". In ordinary programing we distinguish for instance between code, data, a description and a specification language.<br>
How can we interpret the five <i>predicabilia</i> of the <i>Topics</i> using this ontology ? Just consider the judgments we can make:
an object A is an instance of class B, a class A inherits from class B,  object A has method B, class A has method B, only class A has method B, only object A has method B,  class A is obtained from class B by adding methods(or fields) X,Y and Z,  field A of object B is in relation R to field A of object C, etc. Aristotle's use of less or better known attributes might be translated into the distinction between private and public fields and methods. <br>
We must also consider <i>nominalisation</i>, how methods or fields can be transformed into objects (or classes).

So the analysis of what constitutes a valid argument preceeds philosophy. Such an analysis requires a formal abstraction of language and an associated deductive system. Of course
we must carefully analyse what we mean by "abstraction of language", "deduction" (and "inference") and "validity". <br>
The value of most philosophical texts lies in stimulating analysis and  the uncovering of fallacies, argumentative gaps, equivocations and inconsistencies. They are best seen as logical and linguistic puzzles. Otherwise what are most philosophical texts but a pretentious form of existential poetry, myth-making and ideology,  that are, when all is said and done, merely reflecting the life and personality of the philosopher and only have a <i>social</i> validity ? <br>
Intuition and introspection are fundamental to philosophy  but their use  must manifest in the form of argumentation.
<i>To see is to be able to show</i>. <br>
Philosophical logic  engages in the analysis of natural language. For instance formalising the different uses
of the words "and", "or", "not" and "if". The latter gives rise to many problems concerned with finding the right axioms for each such use (i.e. strict implication, material implication, relevant implication, etc.). Another example is intensionality. <br>

Philosophical logic is more fundamental than philosophy. Perhaps the  idea of an absolute independent beginning, a radical doubt uncovering an apodictic -certainty, a linguistic <i>a prior</i> or any other such claim of philosophical boot-strapping has merely an existential, poetical validity. No formal language and deductive system, no serious arguments. No serious arguments, no philosophy.  Sorry.<br>

We must seek for genuine philosophers or at least for genuine philosophical-argumentative content in so-called philosophical texts. Historically speaking, classical philosophers seemed to have exhibited a much higher philosophical standard - giving a chief place to formal rigour and argumentation. Classical philosophy depended on the axiomatic method and the project of formalising natural language based argumentation discourse. Only a modest part of modern philosophy is argumentation-based and founded on the formal axiomatic ideal. Obvious examples are Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza and Frege. To us this is the most important aspect, independently of the views which are defended. Kant's Critique of Pure Reason is not a formal axiomatic argumentative work, only small sections (often flawed) could meet this standard. There not even an attempt to give a clear consistent definition of "reason" and "understanding".  This work is scattered with interesting ideas, projects, metaphors, phenomenological insights accompanied by an abundance of rhetorical pursuasion and sophistry. In ethics Kant appears to deploy far more formal rigour and argumentive sophistication.<br>


The system of all algorithms $T$ in all its different embodiments (according to Church's thesis), such as $\lambda$-terms,  has an objective universal reality. $T$ is the <i>a priori</i> and the <i>given</i>. But $T$ co-implies arithmetic and all possible  recursively axiomatisable deductive systems. Our philosophy might be called <i>Hilbertian Platonism</i>.</p></span>

is intimately connected with the problem of determinism. It is by no means established that 
time can be adequately modelled by the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ or a closed interval thereof.
If time had an ordinal structure then it is easy to define a notion of transfinite computability.
Ordinals embody a polarisation, a chosen direction given by the sucessor or limit ordinal. But the order
of the reals does not have such a direction though the axiom of choice implies that such an order can be defined.
The way "deterministic" systems are specified over the reals, for instance via differential (or integral-differential) equations is extremely perplexing. For then any computationally deterministic model must be considered a mere approximation
with bounded validity relative to a given error. But this polarisation or prefered direction is present in the context of physics. We have the concept of entropy. Naively we can think of entropy as a measure of the lack of structure or information. For instance a cyphertext which cannot be deciphered because no structure can be extracted from it using statistical analysis would have maximum entropy. A class of dynamical systems which preserve a certain measure also exhibit this property of "mixing" and the dissolution of structure. Where does this direction, this symmetry breaking come from ?
Can we define rigorously the mirror class of dynamical systems - just as deterministic - which instead is entropy decreasing and which has a <i>normal tendency</i> to evolve in the direction of producing more structure and information, even if in only sparse outbursts ? Classical systems of course can be reversed in a simple way, the gas returning to one compartment of the box is just as mathematically correct as the gas diffusion. But our models for gases are idealisations and approximations. A complete fundamental physics at the subatomic level eludes us. Maybe studying this problem first for ordinals might shed some light on the more general problem. Perhaps entropy-decreasing systems must be stochastic in the sense that the structure-informed next state is decided by some sort of probabilistic "collapse of the wave-function". We conjecture that this problem might be the key to solving the problems of both quantum theory and biological evolution and speciation. 
Biological evolution is the result of natural systems which behave like other natural system except with time inversed. Broken shards jumping up on the table to produce a tea-cup is no more mathematically or physically mysterious than the tea-cup falling and breaking. Some of the fields of nature, such as gravity and the electroweak force, are time-positive whilst others are time-negative so that periodic bursts of spontaneous information-increasing assemblage are to be expected.
Also the collapse of the wave-function represents the creation of information.
 Particle physics accepted negative mass and energy and even the metaphor of "particles travelling backwards in time". 
Perhaps time-positive and time-negative forces balance themselves so as to  produce  zero net-increase in entropy (perhaps a little like in Prigogine). We see this at the level of biochemistry in the fundamental division between anabolic and catabolic processes. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle may reflect this balance between information and uncertainty at a fundamental level. There must be laws of conservation for matter, energy <i>and information</i>.</p></span>

"Unger has always been a very original and independent philosopher, never swayed excessively by fashion. One of the two main themes of <i>All the Power in the World</i> is a defense of the dualist view that mental substances or individuals are wholly non-physical, and have the power to make things happen in the physical world. For example, we have the power to act freely, and the evident exercise of this power is incompatible with physicalism.... This argument is familiar, of course, though Unger's own version of it is characteristically inventive. Less familiar are Unger's ingenious arguments for dualism later in the book, based on 'the problem of the many' for which Unger is well known.... In a fascinating discussion... Unger draws the conclusion that he is not a physical thing: dualism is true and physicalism is false."--Tim Crane, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>

"Knowledge" is ascribing probabilites
    	      to events, states of affair or propositions. In function of the data we progressively collect, this "knowledge" is then revised by applying
    	      the same kind of linear transformation (or integral). Somehow then, or so the Bayesian story goes, our hypotheses become more certain.
    	      This model is dubious. The progress of physics, in which new data was as vital as new theory was to obtain the said data - was achieved
    	      through striking qualititative leaps and creative discontinuities, involving in a necessary way the deployment of ever more complex 
    	      mathematical concepts held to be absolutely certain in their domain of applicability. This process - which is at the heart of all
    	      advance in natural science - is irreducible to, and extremely far removed from applications of a uniform algorithm to formalised
    	      probabilistic belief systems and data sets. Mathematics - or its more fundamental domains such as arithmetic - is the most certain of sciences. 
    	      We can speak of plausibilities and heuristics at a meta-level discussing certain axioms and sure, there can be experimental-computational
    	      approaches to certain problems. We can even develop systems of probabilistic logic, but only according to a non-probabilistic meta-theory.
    	      But to ascribe probabilities to arithmetical propositions and somehow claim to deploy deduction 
    	      (and should not the rules then be probabilistic too?) is plainly absurd. 
	       
	      
    	      It is certainly not a key to epistemological problems or the philosophy of science. Probability is either an obvious property of a collection of data - and has nothing to do with chance or belief or certainty - or else an a priori arithmetical property of the state space of a combinatoric system - and has nothing to do with chance or belief or certainty. In conclusion: the progress of science and human knowledge is not about passively adjusting in a linear, mechanical way our theories to the evidence but about creatively interpreting new evidence in such a way that we can effect discontinuous leaps in the completeness and sophistication of our theories. This in turn leads us to ask nature new questions which can be answered with new meaningful data. This is also how living organisms relate, actively and creatively "adapt" to their changing environment. The advancement of knowledge is not about progressively "adjusting" the parameters of a fixed framework to optimise its relationship to the data (as in machine learning, or in the myth of beneficial genetic mutations) but primarily about extending in radical ways the framework itself or overhauling it completely. Another major point is that if scientific theories are axiomatic systems then the process of deducing consequences of those theories or proving their consistency is also non-linear and often not even computable.
    <br>
    If we want to relate combinatoric games such as Chess and Go to the concept of intelligence then the computational resources have to be factored in. It is not a question of simply winning or losing, for a massive machine operating at supra-luminal speed doing a brute force search has almost zero intelligence and yet would beat all human and machine players known at present. Also what about the concept of cheating ? Is it fair or even interesting if the computer can "cheat" and the human can't ? If a Chess player stopped the game to look up a game in a book or ran another program, would this not be cheating ? This ruling out of cheating expresses a restriction on resources.<br><br>
    	      <i>Doing much with little, being creative, this is a reflection of true intelligence in this context of finite combinatoric games.</i><br><br> 
    We can recall also the remarks of Bobby Fischer against play based on mere memorisation. For resources we can consider the typical space and time measures used in structural complexity theory. We can certainly measure the size and number of training sets and iterations used by Alpha Go as well as the resources used during play. For the human player, playing well, we can calculate the number of games ever played or studied, obviously incomparably less. But there is no evidence of unusual intense neural activity - i.e. use of resources - during the play that could correlate with intense conceptual strategic thinking. The resources of the human mind seem to be residually small. Hence the performance and intelligence of the human mind in games such as Chess and Go is vastly superior to programs based on machine learning</p></span>

Units of meaning come together, they combine. But to combine they need receptors and connectors. And after combination the result must have itself new receptors and receivers as an undivided whole. Connections can have a polarity or not. This

But how do we identify a term as categorical, how do we know that the denying of the existence of something is either an attempt at abolishing a category or simply taking place legitimately within a another species of  talk?  
If I deny the existence of witches then I am denying the existence of  certain kind of being; but I am also abolishing a whole kind of  talk, namely,  witch-talk . This later fact does not invalidate the former claim. And this claim pertains itself to  a talk regarding what kind of things exist. Indeed, should the former claim turn out to be true, the abolishing of witch-talk is quite justified.
In medieval science there was a whole kind of talk involving final causes.  Thereafter it became  quite  legitimate to question the use of this kind of language in science.  In such a debate one cannot simply appeal to the existence of a language-game in the past.
Finally, the limits of a given kind of talk or language-game are not given to us immediately. To posit these is no longer a linguistic, but a philosophical problem.</p></span>

To specify a set we can list all the elements that belong to it and then all the elements that belong to each one of these elements and so forth (rigorously this is to be understood in terms of ordinals and assuming the axiom of choice). In Cohen's forcing technique there is the notion of a P-name, where P is some set endowed with a preorder. A
 P-name is simply a set viewed as a tree but with each node labelled with an element of P.  An ordinary set  can be seen as a P-name with its tree's nodes tagged with the top element 1
of P. Given a P-name  and a subset G⊆P we can obtain a normal set by going through the tree and prunning off nodes whose labels do not belong to G and then forgetting the labels and considering the resulting set - this is the interpretation or evaluation map. A particular case is in which P is the set of all Borelian sets of the real interval I. A P -name in then a probabilistically described set.</p></span>

We might take a graph-theoretic approach in which a system is modelled as a digraph, the
vertices being "parts" and the arrows expressing a functional or dependency relationship between parts. <br>

We propose th following definition. A digraph \(G = (V,E)\)
 is <i>essentially interconnected</i> if for every \(v \in V\),
 if we consider the digraph \(G'\) that results from removing \(v\) from \(G\),
 then there are two distinct vertices \(a\) and \(b\) (different from \(v\))
 which can be connected by a directed path from \(a\) to \(b\) in \(G\)
 but not by a directed path from \(a\) to \(b\) in \(G'\).

The general idea is that all vertices are "essential" in the sense that removing a vertex will effect the semiconnectivity structure of the rest of the digraph.

A essentially interconnected digraph can have no source or sink vertices
and need not be weakly connected (just take the disjoint union of cycles). Such examples are trivially also not strongly connected. Here is a weakly connected essentially interconnected graph which is not strongly connected. Let the vertices of \(G\) be \(a,b,c,d,e,f\)
 and the directed edges be
$$(a,b),(b,c),(c,a) , (d,e),(e,f),(f,d) , (b,d)$$
It seems that \(G\) is essentially interconnected but is is not strongly connected as there is no oriented path from \(d\) to \(b\).</p></span>
