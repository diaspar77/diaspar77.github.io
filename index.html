    <h3>Axioms and Proposals</h3>
    
    
    <br>
    
    <p>
        
   Welcome to my philosophy site.  Here is a little something about its context. <br><br>
   
   Point 1: There is no obvious relationship between  how 'influential' a philosopher
    is and the intrinisic value or cogency of that philosopher's work. Nor is there any relationship between intrinsic value and the obscurity, density of technical jargon or pretentiousness of a philosophical text.  <br><br>
   
   Point 2: Revisionism and scepticism with regards to mainstream historical narratives is important
   for the practicing philosopher.
   <br><br>
   Point 3: Recall Kuhn's theory of paradigm shifts (the Kuhn cycle). We need to add
   that each paradigm is accompanied by a mythology surrounding its 'founding genius'
   and an associated personality-cult.
   Such are certain sociologically selected individuals who usurp the role of founder or discoverer of a  paradigm while ecclipsing the
   work of others and the complexity of historical reality as well as valid criticism 
   of the paradigm itself.
   <br><br>
   Point 4: It is clear that the investigation of the nature of argumentation and of 
   what it is for an argument of to be valid must preceed all philosophy. The ancients,
   through the investigation of argumentation and inquiry into language, came up with the
   foundations of 'formal logic': the project of formalising natural language,  the idea of argumentation
   based on following well-defined rules within a formal system, the concepts of axiom, definition,
   hypothesis and proof.
  
   <br><br>
   Point 5: Philosophy means philosophical discourse. We hold that philosophical discourse is only
   valid, valuable or meaningful within the framework of a commonly agreed upon system  of 'formal logic'.
   By the latter we mean a universal formal philosophical logic in the spirit of Leibniz's <i>characteristica universalis</i>
   which must involve a formal analysis of natural language.
   Neither Sextus Empiricus nor Hume nor Kant nor Hegel nor Wittgenstein nor Heidegger can escape this requirement and constraint regarding the <i>possibility</i> of such an analysis and formalisation, if they are to be free from the charge of being nonsensical or sophistical.
   
  
   <br><br>
   Point 6: Much of what is termed 'advanced mathematics' or 'advanced programing languages'
   and is above the head of the modern philosopher, is actually nothing more than 
   a sophisticated development of 'formal logic' having connections to abstract
   algebraic geometry and homotopy theory.
   <br><br>
   Point 7: The fact that meaningful philosophical discourse must take place within the framework of 'formal logic' is an argument for the <i>a priori</i> nature of arithmetic and algorithmic structures.
  
   
   <br><br>
   Point 8: In classical mathematical logic there is a syntactical, proof-theoretic approach and there
   is a semantic or model-theoretic approach and these two approaches are of course strongly interrelated.
   What is the semantic correlate to a universal philosophical system of 'formal logic' ? This can only
   be a (mathematical) 'general theory of systems'.
   <br><br>
   Point 9: The main Socratic-Sceptical goal of this site will be not to build a system or even to furnish detailed formal arguments for certain theses but to raise doubts and questions, present important concepts, fragments of arguments  and lesser-known historical facts.
   <br><br>
   Point 10: It seems to me that an important method of 'phenomenology' - or to the philosopy of mind - involves direct instrospection
   of the semantic-pragmatic structure of natural language.  We hold that a detached observation of the immanent contents of one's consciousness (such as the flux of imagination and inner verbal discourse) is both possible and a valid form of direct <i>personal</i> knowledge which transcendends 'formal logic' (without this implying any adherence to philosophical positions commonly associated with either psychologism or phenomenology). But the above does not rule out the necessity of formalisation if such insights are to be communicated or argued about with others. Some questions: what is the role of language in the constitution and structuring of consciousness ? What is the role of language in this detached observation of consciousness ? Is there a fundamental aspect of language which is neither sociological/communicative nor formal and logical ? 
   
   <br><br>
   Point 11: 'Formal logic' is not in itself dogmatic. The least that can be said is that it is a tool for intersocial communication and scientific and philosophical progress. The study - without passing judgments of value - of all modes of linguistic pursuasion and expression (specially artistic) is equally important to philosophy. We might call this 'sociologic', a disciple complementary to philosophical 'formal logic' and vital to human experience and culture. We should place the <i>Poetics</i> and the <i>Rhetoric</i> beside the <i>Organon</i>.
   <br><br>
   Point 12: What about non-verbal communication and meaning or what cannot be expressed easily in a linearly codifiable way ? How can this
   be analysed ? Is philosophy too logocentric (based on the linearly codifiable) ? Can geometry and topology (rooted in pictorial intuition) bridge the gap to a general theory of semiotics ? 
<br><br>
   Point 13: The subjective experience of the body, consciousness capable of experiencing pain and suffering, is an absolute given. We have the certain <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the reality of both our own experience of suffering and the consciousness, the suffering, of other human beings and animals. <i>Patimur ergo sumus</i>. We have the <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the absolute moral law of compassion, empathy and non-harm with regards to sentient beings independently of any naturalistic, utilitarian, empirical justifications. Hence the possibility of knowledge itself and knowledge of the existence and quality of other consciousnesses besides our own. Also the idea of a universal law binding the relationship of different beings seen as parts of an organised whole woven from moral and logical laws.

   
   
   <br><br>
   Point 14: As for political, religious and 'scientific' ideologies we do not ask if they are 'true' or 'false' but whether they are or not a main cause of war, violence and suffering (physical or psychological) of human beings and animals. It should be our hope that mankind will finally evolve (biologically and culturally) in the next few generations so as to leave war and violence  behind forever.
