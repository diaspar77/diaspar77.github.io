     <h3>23rd of November 2022</h3>
     
  
  
  <br><p>These posts will be about philosophical logic, phenomenology and ethics, and on a practical level about anarchism and antinatalism.
         There are the following goals that we hope to achieve: <br>
                  (1) To give an example of completely formal philosophical argumentation by interpreting
                  Uwe Meixner's formal axiomatic ontology using a proof assistant. <br>
                  (2) To give the most detailed analysis available today of the logical structure of the argumentation present in Sextus Empiricus'
                  <i>Outlines</i> and in Hume's <i>Treatise</i>.<br>
                  (3) To give the outline of a formal ethics based on empathy, compassion, self-control and self-knowledge. <br>
                  (4) To expand the thought 
                  of William Kingdon Clifford: <i>There is one thing in the world more wicked than the desire to command and that is the will to obey.
                  </i><br>
                  (5) Reason and experience together with  universal ethical principles play a vital irreplaceable role in maintaining a certain
                  kind of relationship between the individual and the 'social body'.
