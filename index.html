          The subjective experience of the body, consciousness capable of experiencing pain and suffering, is an absolute given. We have the certain <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the reality of both our own experience of suffering and the consciousness, the suffering, of other human beings and animals. <i>Patimur ergo sumus</i>. We have the <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the absolute moral law of compassion, empathy and non-harm with regards to sentient beings independently of any naturalistic, utilitarian, empirical justifications. Hence the possibility of knowledge itself and knowledge of the existence and quality of other consciousnesses besides our own. Also the idea of a universal law binding the relationship of different beings seen as parts of an organised whole woven from moral and logical laws.  Immediate action needs to be taken to stop experimentation on animals.
   
   
   
    As a corollary of point we have the gravity and seriousness of  being
   a direct cause of the arising into this world of another consciousness capable of suffering.
   We can indeed speak of the rights of the unborn.
   <i>De som formerer seg, erkjenner ikke at den fremtidige personen de skaper kanskje ikke ønsker å bli født og kanskje til og med
      en dag skulle ønske at de aldri hadde blitt født. I kjernen er det å frivillig få barn en egoistisk handling som ikke tar tilstrekkelig
      hensyn til interessene til fremtidig liv og allerede eksisterende liv</i>.
   Human beings differ in their habits and dispositions (in mental 'character'), and in the underlying causes which generate these habits and dispositions. These can be seen as qualities which can be more or less 'good'. Supremely good character traits are compassion/empathy, the habitual love/desire for knowledge and truth obtained via careful study and analysis together with self-knowledge and self-control. These are underlying internal causes which manifest exteriorly. These causes
   are also closely connected with freedom and deliberation.

     <h3>23rd of November 2022</h3>
     
  
  
  <br><p>These posts will be about philosophical logic, phenomenology and ethics, and on a practical level about anarchism and antinatalism.
         There are the following goals that we hope to achieve: <br>
                  (1) To give an example of completely formal philosophical argumentation by interpreting
                  Uwe Meixner's formal axiomatic ontology using a proof assistant. <br>
                  (2) To give the most detailed analysis available today of the logical structure of the argumentation present in Sextus Empiricus'
                  <i>Outlines</i> and in Hume's <i>Treatise</i>.<br>
                  (3) To give the outline of a formal ethics based on empathy, compassion, self-control and self-knowledge. <br>
                  (4) To expand the thought 
                  of William Kingdon Clifford: <i>There is one thing in the world more wicked than the desire to command and that is the will to obey.
                  </i><br>
                   Reason and experience together with  universal ethical principles play a vital irreplaceable role in maintaining a certain
                  kind of relationship between the individual and the 'social body'. There is no "enlightenment" outside of "enlightened" individuals.
                  And it is a fact that these have existed and struggled since recorded time. <i>The Enlightenment</i> is a timeless tradition which has existed antagonistically alongside 
                  
     
                  other "traditions". It is the various contemporary irrationalist currents of relativism,
                  deconstructivism and collectivism that can be construed as ideologies of absolutism and terror, useful subjugating tools in the
                  hands of wealth, control, superstition, violence and power. For they undermine the bulwark that empowers and protects the individual
                  from the "State" and the "Church", both inwardly and practically. It is through the critical exercise of logic and reason,
                  through self-defense when necessary or compassion for other sentient beings that the individual becomes an individual, i.e., becomes free
                  and self-determined.
                  
                  The irony is that once the absolute status is negated
                    to logic and objective knowledge, to subjective verification, to universal moral principles (i.e. human and animal rights), then the absolute
                  becomes man, or rather, historical human organisations. It is the  "guru", "cult",  "corporation", "military",  "Church" and "government" that become
                  the absolute demanding unquestioning
                  obedience and submission. This is seen in various traditional currents of Buddhism such as Vajrayana and Ch'an/Zen which apparently
                  teach Mâdhyamaka-type doctrines (which are at least superficially similar to Pyrrhonism, Humean empiricsm or the later Wittgenstein).
                  But
                  if you examine these currents you will find unquestioned guru-worship and guru-submission tied to extreme collectivism.
                  It is no surprise that we find sexual misconduct, physical and psychological cruelty and violence. <br>
                  
                  Language serves the rhetorician and sophist as an instrument of power, influence and control. An abyss separates
                  a mere discourse from a formal argument. Mathematics has always been the irreconcilable enemy of the sophist.
