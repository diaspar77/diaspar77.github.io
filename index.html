     <h3>23rd of November 2022</h3>
     
  
  
  <br><p>These posts will be about philosophical logic, phenomenology and ethics, and on a practical level about anarchism and antinatalism.
         There are the following goals that we hope to achieve: <br>
                  (1) To give an example of completely formal philosophical argumentation by interpreting
                  Uwe Meixner's formal axiomatic ontology using a proof assistant. <br>
                  (2) To give the most detailed analysis available today of the logical structure of the argumentation present in Sextus Empiricus'
                  <i>Outlines</i> and in Hume's <i>Treatise</i>.<br>
                  (3) To give the outline of a formal ethics based on empathy, compassion, self-control and self-knowledge. <br>
                  (4) To expand the thought 
                  of William Kingdon Clifford: <i>There is one thing in the world more wicked than the desire to command and that is the will to obey.
                  </i><br>
                   Reason and experience together with  universal ethical principles play a vital irreplaceable role in maintaining a certain
                  kind of relationship between the individual and the 'social body'. There is no "enlightenment" outside of "enlightened" individuals.
                  And it is a fact that these have existed and struggled since recorded time. <i>The Enlightenment</i> is a timeless tradition which has existed antagonistically alongside 
                  
     
                  other "traditions". It is the various contemporary irrationalist currents of relativism,
                  deconstructivism and collectivism that can be construed as ideologies of absolutism and terror, useful subjugating tools in the
                  hands of wealth, control, superstition, violence and power. For they undermine the bulwark that empowers and protects the individual
                  from the "State" and the "Church", both inwardly and practically. The irony is that once the absolute status is negated
                    to logic and objective knowledge, to subjective verification, to universal moral principles (i.e. human and animal rights), then the absolute
                  becomes man, or rather, historical human organisations. It is the changeable, hypocritical, criminal "guru", "cult",  "corporation", "military",  "Church" and "government" that become
                  the absolute demanding unquestioning
                  obedience and submission. This is seen in various traditional currents of Buddhism such as Vajrayana and Ch'an/Zen which apparently
                  teach Madhyamaka-type doctrines (which are at least superficially similar to Pyrrhonism, Humean empiricsm or the later Wittgenstein).
                  But
                  if you examine these currents you will find the most extreme guru-worship and guru-submission tied to extreme collectivism and thus with
                  the expected sexual misconduct, physical and psychological control, cruelty and violence.
