    <h3>Axioms and Proposals</h3>
    
    
    <br>
    
    <p>
        
   Welcome to my philosophy site.  Here is a little something about its context. <br><br>
   
   Point 1: There is no obvious relationship between  how 'influential' a philosopher
    is and the intrinisic value or cogency of that philosopher's work. Nor is there any relationship between intrinsic value and the obscurity, density of technical jargon or pretentiousness of a philosophical text.  <br><br>
   
   Point 2: Revisionism and scepticism with regards to mainstream historical narratives is important
   for the practicing philosopher.
   <br><br>
   Point 3: Recall Kuhn's theory of paradigm shifts (the Kuhn cycle). We need to add
   that each paradigm is accompanied by a mythology surrounding its 'founding genius'
   and an associated personality-cult.
   Such are certain sociologically selected individuals who usurp the role of founder or discoverer of a  paradigm while ecclipsing the
   work of others and the complexity of historical reality as well as valid criticism 
   of the paradigm itself.
   <br><br>
   Point 4: It is clear that the investigation of the nature of argumentation and of 
   what it is for an argument of to be valid must preceed all philosophy. The ancients,
   through the investigation of argumentation and inquiry into language, came up with the
   foundations of 'formal logic': the project of formalising natural language,  the idea of argumentation
   based on following well-defined rules within a formal system, the concepts of axiom, definition,
   hypothesis and proof.
  
   <br><br>
   Point 5: Philosophy means philosophical discourse. We hold that philosophical discourse is only
   valid, valuable or meaningful within the framework of a commonly agreed upon system  of 'formal logic'.
   By the latter we mean a universal formal philosophical logic in the spirit of Leibniz's <i>characteristica universalis</i>
   which must involve a formal analysis of natural language.
   Neither Sextus Empiricus nor Hume nor Kant nor Hegel nor Wittgenstein nor Heidegger can escape this requirement and constraint regarding the <i>possibility</i> of such an analysis and formalisation, if they are to be free from the charge of being nonsensical or sophistical.
   
  
   <br><br>
   Point 6: Much of what is termed 'advanced mathematics' or 'advanced programing languages'
   and is above the head of the modern philosopher, is actually nothing more than 
   a sophisticated development of 'formal logic' having connections to abstract
   algebraic geometry and homotopy theory.
   <br><br>
   Point 7: The fact that meaningful philosophical discourse must take place within the framework of 'formal logic' is an argument for the <i>a priori</i> nature of arithmetic and algorithmic structures.
   Philosophical discourse only makes sense within the context of a mutually agree-upon formal-logical and deductive framework. For instance, given a theory in mathematical physics, we can ask then, what is causality ? How does it relate to time ? Do have have indiscernability ? Only in a formal ontological framework such as employed in Artificial Intelligence or Knowledge Representation can we ask classical philosophical questions in a meaningful way.
  
   
   <br><br>
   
   Point 8: The stumbling block for ill-founded pretentious philosophy is mathematics. The philosophy of mathematics truly occupies a central place in philosophy. How can you justify your claims about knowledge, truth, introspection and intuition, proof, sentences, propositions, meaning, reference, objects, without testing these claims against mathematical knowledge, mathematical truth , mathematical introspection and intuition, mathematical proof, mathematical sentences, mathematical propositions, mathematical meaning, mathematical reference, mathematical objects ? 

The dominant currents in post-war Western philosophy represent everything that both Frege and Husserl most vehemently and vigorously opposed and argued against.  <br><br>
   
   Point 9: In classical mathematical logic there is a syntactical, proof-theoretic approach and there
   is a semantic or model-theoretic approach and these two approaches are of course strongly interrelated.
   What is the semantic correlate to a universal philosophical system of 'formal logic' ? This can only
   be a (mathematical) 'general theory of systems'.
   <br><br>
   Point 10: The main Socratic-Sceptical goal of this site will be not to build a system or even to furnish detailed formal arguments for certain theses but to raise doubts and questions, present important concepts, fragments of arguments  and lesser-known historical facts.
   <br><br>
   Point 11: It seems to me that an important method of 'phenomenology' - or to the philosopy of mind - involves direct instrospection
   of the semantic-pragmatic structure of natural language.  We hold that a detached observation of the immanent contents of one's consciousness (such as the flux of imagination and inner verbal discourse) and the <i>discovery of the great power we have to directly alter and improve the contents of our own experience</i>
   is both possible and a valid form of direct <i>personal</i> knowledge which transcendends 'formal logic' (without this implying any adherence to philosophical positions commonly associated with either psychologism or phenomenology). But the above does not rule out the necessity of formalisation if such insights are to be communicated or argued about with others. Some questions: what is the role of language in the constitution and structuring of consciousness ? What is the role of language in this detached observation of consciousness ? Is there a fundamental aspect of language which is neither sociological/communicative nor formal and logical ? 
   
   <br><br>
   Point 12: 'Formal logic' is not in itself dogmatic. The least that can be said is that it is a tool for intersocial communication and scientific and philosophical progress. The study - without passing judgments of value - of all modes of linguistic pursuasion and expression (specially artistic) is equally important to philosophy. We might call this 'sociologic', a disciple complementary to philosophical 'formal logic' and vital to human experience and culture. We should place the <i>Poetics</i> and the <i>Rhetoric</i> beside the <i>Organon</i>.
   <br><br>
   Point 13: What about non-verbal communication and meaning or what cannot be expressed easily in a linearly codifiable way ? How can this
   be analysed ? Is philosophy too logocentric (based on the linearly codifiable) ? Can geometry and topology play an important role in a general theory of semiotics ? 
<br><br>
 
Point 14: Philosophy runs up against unsolvable problems: the nature of time, the nature of concepts,
trying to organise concepts when concepts are always conceptually related and conceived, the role of sensation and imagination in cognition, the vagueness and ambiguity of natural language, the impossibility of giving precise and uniquely identifying definitions of things, the relationship between type discipline and meaning in natural language, the pictorial aspect of communication, the difficulty in formalising the arguments of the 'great philosophers',  etc.

The correct approach to setting up a universal philosophical 'formal logic' involves the study of mathematical general systems theory and theoretical physics (such as loop quantum gravity), the more formal and logical disciplines of Artificial Intelligence (knowledge representation, multi-agent systems, simulation and game-engines) together with systems biology. We introduce a methodological third-person epokhe whereby the conceptual perspective of all first-person experience (in self and others) and what Frege called 'imagination' is suspended. <i>This does not contradict point 10.</i> The paradox is that consciousness is associated with a finite spatial-temporally conditioned ego and its world-relations. But in
many spiritual and philosophical traditions the condition for attainment of the 'true' mind and 'higher' unlimited consciousness is precisely the abrogation of this ego.


   
   
   <br><br>
    Point 15: The subjective experience of the body, consciousness capable of experiencing pain and suffering, is an absolute given. We have the certain <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the reality of both our own experience of suffering and the consciousness, the suffering, of other human beings and animals. <i>Patimur ergo sumus</i>. We have the <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the absolute moral law of compassion, empathy and non-harm with regards to sentient beings independently of any naturalistic, utilitarian, empirical justifications. Hence the possibility of knowledge itself and knowledge of the existence and quality of other consciousnesses besides our own. Also the idea of a universal law binding the relationship of different beings seen as parts of an organised whole woven from moral and logical laws.  Immediate action needs to be taken to stop experimentation on animals.
   
   <br><br>
   
   Point 16: As a corollary of point 14 we have the gravity and seriousness of  being
   a direct cause of the arising into this world of another consciousness capable of suffering.
   We can indeed speak of the rights of the unborn.
   De som formerer seg, erkjenner ikke at den fremtidige personen de skaper kanskje ikke ønsker å bli født og kanskje til og med en dag skulle ønske at de aldri hadde blitt født. I kjernen er det å frivillig få barn en egoistisk handling som ikke tar tilstrekkelig hensyn til interessene til fremtidig liv og allerede eksisterende liv.
   Human beings differ in their habits and dispositions (in mental 'character'), and in the underlying causes which generate these habits and dispositions. These can be seen as qualities which can be more or less 'good'. Supremely good character traits are compassion/empathy, the habitual love/desire for knowledge and truth obtained via careful study and analysis together with self-knowledge and self-control. These are underlying internal causes which manifest exteriorly. These causes
   are also closely connected with freedom and deliberation. 
   
   
   
   <br><br>
   
   Point 17: As for political, religious and 'scientific' ideologies we do not ask if they are 'true' or 'false' but whether they are or not a main cause of war, violence and suffering (physical or psychological) of human beings and animals. It should be our hope that mankind will finally evolve (biologically and culturally) in the next few generations so as to leave war and violence  behind forever. This will come about by a <i>conscious regulation</i> of the number and <i>quality</i> (in the sense of point 15) of the human population.  We need a voluntary drastic decrease in human population (back to the level of the 18th-century) and a voluntary drastic increase in the quality of the population. But so long as there is human life, in order to minimise suffering,  we must guarantee that there are good people. This is the tragedy and paradox of antinatalism: that the good are more likely not to procreate than the bad.
     
   
   <br><br>
   Point 18: In any point of argument what matters is the evidence, facts, reason and moral considerations.
   Whether any belief-system or tradition agrees or not with the point is immaterial. <br><br>
   
   Point 19: There are other plains of existence, other dimensions, other perspectives, others modes and faculties of being, experience and cognition, some possibly deeper and more thorough. The factors which ordinarily limit us need not always do so. There is far more to reality than what we ordinarily conceive or experience.
