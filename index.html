  We consider a community of monads each having their own phenomenological sphere.  To this end 
       we consider the class of first-order theories $T_S$ over a first-order languages $S$. First for simplicity suppose that $S$ is fixed.
       Each monad has so many <i>modes</i> which correspond to (generally incomplete) theories $T_\alpha$ indexed by some ordinal $\omega$.  We suppose
       that $\alpha < \beta$ implies that $T_\alpha \subset T_\beta$. We suppose that at the limit $T_\omega$ is complete. <br>
       A <i>world</i> is a theory $W$ which specifies how monads in given modes coexist on a certain plane.  Worlds are also indexed by ordinals.
       
       The <i>pleroma</i> is the highest world of completed monads and so consists of complete theories. The Henads of Proclus. Recall
       that in algebraic geometry points correspond to maximal ideals.

 <div class="center"><p><h3>Some problems with Antinatalism</h3></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p class="des"></p><p> 
 
 Intelligent and compassionate people are more likely than less intelligent and compassionate people to harken to 
 antinalist arguments and abstain from procreation out of compassion. This will result in the long run in a genetic deterioration of mankind as a whole
 and hence in the increase of suffering and the increase in procreation. So long as there are human beings we need to guarantee the existence
 of compassionate and intelligent people.<br><br>
 
 
 We do not know the nature of the relationship between the mind and the body.  Parents do not "create" their offspring but merely
 are causal factors in the origin of the physical organism. Hence in order to be certain that a certain life better had never been we would have to know
 about the possible pre-natal and post-mortem existence an individual consciousness. But we do not. <br><br>
 
 
 On the other hand the decrease of the human population to the level of the 18th-century  is a moral and ecological imperative. 
 It is also imperative to eradicate the culture, values and norms of procreation that permeates society.
 It is an imperative that children are not allowed to be born into environments were they will certainly undergo physical and/or psychological
 abuse and suffering.
 
 It is an ideal that there be a decrease in the human population but an increase in quality.  There are however no clear methods to achieve
 this. We can always cry "education !".  Education based on the importance of compassion/empathy and the love of learning and clear thinking for their own sake. <br>
 
 To say "anarchism" is like saying "medicine" or "immune system": it is necessary action to be taken against totalitarian indoctrination and oppression.
 It has nothing to do with the healthy organism which must exist afterwards and which is its ultimate reason.
 Government exists to protect the weak and the ensure that the rights of all are respected. Government exists as a form of necessary cooperation
 and sharing. Government exists voluntarily and for the good of all.

 <div class="center"><p><h3>Ambiguity of the term "Religion"</h3></p><p class="des"></p><p>
The tragedy of "Religion" is that it containts two completely  disparate and heterogenous elements. <br>
Religion A is the domain of the philosopher-theologian, the authentic mystic, the romantic or platonic lover, the artist, the morality of empathy and compassion and the inspired social reformer. Religion A in the West
has been all but indistinguishable from Neoplatonism and kindred movements in ancient India. It is based on neither causing suffering or harm to oneself 
  nor to others.<br><br>
Religion B or religion proper is the great calamity of mankind.  This materialist religion is all about superstition, ignorance, fear, mental illness, violence,  oppression
and the confusion and perversion of human feelings and instincts.

Its main worldly field of action is in maintaining social power-structures and is focused on gender roles, sexuality, procreation, the family, policing and militarism.

<div class="center"><p><h3>Hegel and Metamathematics</h3></p><p class="des"></p><p>

Unlike Marxist Lawvere's and String Theorist Schreiber's higher topos theoretic lucubrations on Hegel via adjunctions we think it
 is clear that the "understanding" deals with plain old classical contradictions (not adjunctions of modalities) which are then resolved via abstract formal phenomenological
 introspection. Also the unit type is not the empty type. To us the proof of inconsistency is itself a formal process which transcends (or subsumes) the contradiction of the system
 in the object language.  We can in fact use both incompleteness and inconsistency. The first incompleteleness theorem in fact uses contradiction.
 Did Hegel distinguish between the two ? Did Kant conceive of his antinomies as showing incompleteness or inconsistency ? <br>
 
 A Hegel-Hilbert system thus consists of a series of systems $L_1, L_2,...,L_i,...$ such that each system is faithfully mirrored and shown to be 
 incomplete in the system immediately above it. The undecidable propositions also acquires a meta-meaning in the system above. For instance
 GÃ¶del's sentence becomes true.
 An analogy is found in the construction of the algebraic closure of a field. <br>
 
 Also Hegel's logic can be seen as the logic of logic. For any system it is the logic of how the system is expounded or expounds itself.<br>

<div class="center"><p><h3>Social Wisdom</h3></p><p class="des"></p><p> 

 The family, though obviously important for early development, is insufficient to prepare you for the world.
 When you do not get along with a family-member or get into an argument or fight, you generally make up afterwards.
 A  father, mother, sister or brother is still a father, mother, sister or brother after all.  This minimises the importance of differences and incompatibilites
 and puts the emphasis on the person as a person.
  The problem is that this creates a very
 bad outlook and habit for dealing with the real world and other people. With the habitual mindset we have with family members it
 makes it easy for us to idealise and selectively perceive
  other people and have unhealthy and unfair and unrealistic demands from them. It makes it very hard to let go.
 There is also much infantile mythology or cosmology at play which is harmful beyond youth and the family environment.
 
 <br>
 
 In the vast majority of unhappy social relationships clear "red flags" are always given at a early stage which are sufficient grounds
 for us to know that we should steer clear from them.  But we ignore these and see only what we want or dream. <br>
 With the family the substance is everything and quality and form can be discarded. In the real world quality and form are everything
 and substance is secondary. In the vast majority of cases the person is to be discarded. That is, you should opt not to form  or desire
 to form a close relationship with that person.
