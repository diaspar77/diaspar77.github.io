  We consider a community of monads each having their own phenomenological sphere.  To this end 
       we consider the class of first-order theories $T_S$ over a first-order languages $S$. First for simplicity suppose that $S$ is fixed.
       Each monad has so many <i>modes</i> which correspond to (generally incomplete) theories $T_\alpha$ indexed by some ordinal $\omega$.  We suppose
       that $\alpha < \beta$ implies that $T_\alpha \subset T_\beta$. We suppose that at the limit $T_\omega$ is complete. <br>
       A <i>world</i> is a theory $W$ which specifies how monads in given modes coexist on a certain plane.  Worlds are also indexed by ordinals.
       
       The <i>pleroma</i> is the highest world of completed monads and so consists of complete theories. The Henads of Proclus. Recall
       that in algebraic geometry points correspond to maximal ideals.

 <div class="center"><p><h3>Some problems with Antinatalism</h3></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p class="des"></p><p> 
 
 Intelligent and compassionate people are more likely than less intelligent and compassionate people to harken to 
 antinalist arguments and abstain from procreation out of compassion. This will result in the long run in a genetic deterioration of mankind as a whole
 and hence in the increase of suffering and the increase in procreation. So long as there are human beings we need to guarantee the existence
 of compassionate and intelligent people.<br><br>
 
 
 We do not know the nature of the relationship between the mind and the body.  Parents do not "create" their offsprings but merely
 are causal factors in the origin of the physical organism. Hence in order to be certain that a certain life better had never been we would have to know
 about the possible pre-natal and post-mortem existence an individual consciousness. But we do not. <br><br>
 
 
 On the other hand the decrease of the human population to the level of the 18th-century  is a moral and ecological imperative. 
 It is also imperative to eradicate the culture, values and norms of procreation that permeates society.
 It is an imperative that children are not allowed to be born into environments were they will certainly undergo physical and/or psychological
 abuse and suffering.
 
 It is an ideal that there be a decrease in the human population but an increase in quality.  There are however no clear methods to achieve
 this. We can always cry "education !".  Education based on the importance of compassion/empathy and the love of learning and clear thinking for their own sake. <br>

 <div class="center"><p><h3>Ambiguity of the term "Religion"</h3></p><p class="des"></p>
The tragedy of "Religion" is that it containts two completely  disparate and heterogenous elements. <br>
Religion A is the domain of the philosopher-theologian, the mystic, the lover, the artist, the morality of empathy and compassion and the inspired social reformer. Religion A in the West
has been all but indistinguishable from Neoplatonism and kindred movements in ancient India. <br>
Religion B or religion proper is the great calamity of mankind.  This materialist religion is all about superstition, ignorance, fear, violence,  oppression
and the confusion and perversion of human feelings and instincts.

Its main sphere of preocuupation and action regards  gender roles, sexuality, eroticism, procreation, the family,  social power-structures, militarism and punishment.

<div class="center"><p><h3>Hegel and Metamathematics</h3></p><p class="des"></p><p>

Unlike Marxist Lawvere's and String Theorist Schreiber's higher topos theoretic lucubrations on Hegel via adjunctions we think it
 is clear that the "understanding" deals with plain old classical contradictions (not adjunctions of modalities) which are then resolved via abstract formal phenomenological
 introspection. Also the unit type is not the empty type. To us the proof of inconsistency is itself a formal process which transcends (or subsumes) the contradiction of the system
 in the object language.  We can in fact use both incompleteness and inconsistency. The first incompleteleness theorem uses contradiction.
 Did Hegel distinguish between the two ? <br>
 
 A Hegel-Hilbert system thus consists of a series of systems $L_1, L_2,...,L_i,...$ such that each language is a metalanguage with regard
 to the one immediately preceeding it. Each system is shown to be  incomplete in the system above it.
 An analogy is found in the construction of the algebraic closure of a field. <br>
 
 Also Hegel's logic can be seen as the logic of logic. For any system it is the logic of how the system is expounded or expounds itself.
